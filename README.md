# 2024-kreleases

This Power BI project provides an insight into 2024 releases of Korean dramas, mini-series, and movies.
Dataset is in .xlsx format.

A few disclaimers:
• I created my dataset basing on Mydramalist and Wikipedia.
• A Mini-series has to have less than 40-minutes long episodes or in case of 1-hour long episodes, less than 6 episodes in total. Otherwise it is categorized as a Drama.
• Release date for Movies is the date of screening in cinemas, not on festivals.
